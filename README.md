# new_course

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is about making an app that shows and displays courses 
** Each course has its title, subtitle, image (optional) and lessons
** Each lesson is represented by a youtube link which the user can watch using the app. 
** The youtube video could be unlisted so that it's only available through the app.

The app provides a dashboard so that admins can control user's state and courses as well.
** Admins can add new courses to the backend (firestore) so that users can see these new courses.
** Admins can also delete courses from the backend.

** Super admins can add or delete courses like admins.
** Super admins can also determine each user's role when logging in to the app whether the user will be a normal user, amin or super admin.
